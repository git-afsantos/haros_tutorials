# Basic HAROS Tutorial

This directory provides a series of basic exercises to try out [HAROS](https://github.com/git-afsantos/haros) using the ROS packages provided in this repository as a target application for analysis.

The exercises cover various types of analyses with progressing difficulty, from internal code quality to architecture analysis and property-based testing.
If applicable, solutions for the exercises are also provided.
We recommend that the user should get familiar with Fictibot's architecture (see [the docs](https://github.com/git-afsantos/haros_tutorials/tree/master/docs)), if not with the source code itself, in order to better understand the issues HAROS reports, as well as the suggested solutions.

The exercises assume an installation via Docker, using the files provided [in this repository](https://github.com/git-afsantos/haros_tutorials/tree/master/docker), to ensure a common ground.
Other types of HAROS installations should work similarly, but some commands may have to be adapted (e.g., replacing `haros` with `python haros-runner.py` if running from source).
